**Arrays - DS**

Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/arrays-ds/problem

An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array, **A**, of size **N**, each memory location has some unique index, *i* (where 0 <= **i** <= *N*), that can be referenced as *A[i]* (you may also see it written as *Ai*).

Given an array, *A*, of *N* integers, print each element in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.

**Note:** If you've already solved our C++ domain's Arrays Introduction challenge, you may want to skip this.

**Input Format**

* The first line contains an integer, *N* (the number of integers in *A*). 

* The second line contains *N* space-separated integers describing *A*.

**Constraints**

* 1 <= *N* <= 10^3
* 1 <= *A* <= 10^4, where A, in the *ith* integer in *A*

**Output Format**

Print all *N* integers in *A* in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.

**Sample Output 1**

```
2 3 4 1
